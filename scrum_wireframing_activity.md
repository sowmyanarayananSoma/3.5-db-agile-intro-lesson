# 🧭 Lesson Activity: Agile & Scrum Foundations + Wireframing + Optional AI Coding

This canvas contains **full explanations FIRST** (Agile → Scrum → Roles → Ceremonies → Artifacts → Terminology), **THEN** a list of **complex project scenarios**, and finally **a full set of example user stories for one chosen complex project.**

This is the correct structure for teaching.

# 🌀 1. Agile Fundamentals

Agile is a **flexible, iterative, and feedback-driven** approach to building software.

## ⭐ Core Principles of Agile

* Deliver software in **small usable increments**.
* **Embrace change** instead of resisting it.
* Work closely with the customer.
* Collaborate daily within the team.
* Maintain a sustainable pace.
* Continuous reflection and improvement.
* Working software is the **primary measure of progress**.

## ⭐ Why Agile?

Because requirements, markets, users, and technologies change constantly. Agile helps teams:

* Adapt fast
* Reduce wasted work
* Deliver earlier
* Receive feedback sooner

# 🧭 2. What Is Scrum?

Scrum is a **lightweight framework** used to apply Agile principles. It structures teamwork into **sprints**, with defined roles, meetings, and artifacts.

Scrum is NOT a methodology. It is a **framework** for continuous inspection and adaptation.

---

# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 3. Scrum Roles

Scrum defines **three** roles.

### **Product Owner (PO)**

* Owns the **product vision**.
* Manages and prioritizes the **Product Backlog**.
* Ensures the team builds the **right thing**.

### **Scrum Master (SM)**

* Ensures Scrum is understood and followed.
* Removes blockers.
* Facilitates meetings.
* Improves team workflow.

### **Developers (The Dev Team)**

* Build the product.
* Estimate work.
* Create design, code, tests.
* Collaborate daily.

---

# 📅 4. Scrum Ceremonies (Meetings)

These are **timeboxed events** that keep the team aligned.

### **1. Sprint Planning**

* Team selects which user stories go into the sprint.
* Defines the sprint goal.
* Breaks down work when needed.

### **2. Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up)**

15-minute meeting where developers share:

* What they did yesterday
* What they will do today
* What is blocking them

### **3. Sprint Review**

* Team shows completed work to stakeholders.
* Get immediate feedback.

### **4. Sprint Retrospective**

* Team reflects on what went well and what didn’t.
* Creates action items for improvement.

---

# 📦 5. Scrum Artifacts

### **1. Product Backlog**

Full list of all future work.

### **2. Sprint Backlog**

Stories the team commits to delivering this sprint.

### **3. Increment**

Shippable output completed by the end of the sprint.

---

# 🧱 6. Important Terminology

### **User Story**

A short requirement written from the user’s perspective.

> “As a user, I want to ___ so that ___.”

### **Definition of Done (DoD)**

Clear conditions that must be satisfied for a story to be considered done.

### **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**

Smallest set of features that delivers value.

### **Sprint**

1–4 week cycle of development.

### **Kanban Board**

Visual workflow: **To Do → In Progress → Done**.
